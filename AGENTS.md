# Agent Instructions for Invest Calculator Marimo

Welcome, autonomous agent! This repository is an interactive investment and mortgage calculator built using [marimo](https://marimo.io). The project is automatically exported to WebAssembly (WASM) and deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

The user uses this project for learning, so **you must explain complex architectural and coding choices well during the planning phase and at the end of the build**. 

## 1. Workflows & Commands

We use `uv` for fast, reproducible dependency management and execution.

### Local WASM Testing (Critical Before Pushing)
Because GitHub Actions automatically deploys the main branch, and because some Python packages are not WASM-compatible, you should often test the app locally before committing changes.
- **Export Notebooks to WebAssembly:** 
  ```bash
  uv run .github/scripts/build.py
  ```
- **Serve Local Site:**
  ```bash
  python -m http.server -d _site
  ```
  *(Preview changes at `http://localhost:8000` to verify WASM compatibility in the browser)*

### Linting & Formatting
- **Check Linting Errors:** `uv run ruff check .`
- **Apply Formatting:** `uv run ruff check --fix .` and `uv run ruff format .`

### Testing
There is no formal test suite yet. Ad-hoc testing is done in the `local_testing/` folder.
If `pytest` is introduced in the future:
- **Run All Tests:** `uv run pytest`
- **Run a Single Test Function:** `uv run pytest path/to/test_file.py::test_function_name`

## 2. Agent Skills
There are several marimo-specific skills available in the environment. Whenever you are performing tasks related to marimo notebooks, you MUST check for and load relevant skills using your `skill` tool.
- Use the `wasm-compatibility` skill to check if packages are compatible with WebAssembly.
- Use the `marimo-notebook` skill for guidance on writing marimo notebooks in the correct Python format.

## 3. Code Style & Architecture Guidelines

### Core Principles
- **Readability & Modularity:** Emphasize readable, reusable, and modular code. Break down large complex cells into smaller helper functions when possible.
- **Commenting:** Provide high-quality, explanatory comments for complex or verbose logic (e.g., financial math or data transformations).

### Frameworks & Libraries
- **Marimo:** Files in `apps/` (like `apps/dashboard_stock_investment.py`) maintain the `@app.cell` decorator structure. Use `mo.ui` for interactive elements and `mo.md` for markdown. 
- **Polars over Pandas:** We use `polars` (`import polars as pl`) exclusively for dataframes to ensure maximum performance. 
- **Altair:** Use `altair` (`import altair as alt`) for all data visualizations. 

### Imports & File Structure
- Due to the nature of marimo notebooks, imports are generally done inside the cell where they are first used or returned to be shared across cells. 
- The user is primarily working out of `apps/dashboard_stock_investment.py` (which runs in `--mode run`). Other notebooks may just be template placeholders.

### Typing & Naming
- Always use Python type hints for function signatures (e.g., `def calculate(amount: float) -> pl.DataFrame:`).
- **Variables & Functions:** Use `snake_case`.
- **Constants:** Use `UPPER_CASE` for global constants.
